# Hello, Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Louí Byrne.

I work as a Mechanical and Control Systems Engineer at AAC Clyde Space in Scotland.
In my daily work, I design satellites and their attitude control systems. We use sensors to look at the sun and stars to determine our attitude, run mathematical algorithms to calculate control inputs and actuate reaction wheels and magnetometers to move us in that direction.

I am passionate about robotics and embedded systems and strive to build tools to improve our quality of life here on Earth.

## My Projects
[Nanosatellite Testbed: ](https://github.com/loby368/Nanosatellite-Testbed) This is my capstone thesis project as part of my MSc Aerospace Engineer at KTH, Stockholm. 
I developed an attitude control testbed simulating zero gravity to run novel control algorithms. This project exposed me to embedded systems development on an STM32 and ignited my excitement to work more in embedded systems in my career. I developed a C wrapper to run a Simulink-embedded coder algorithm on an STM32, developed sensor drivers, implemented I2C, Serial and CANBus protocols, and ran control system experiments.

## Career Ambitions
I have always been passionate about the intersection between mechanical, electronic, and computer systems.
My dream job is developing computer vision applications for embedded real-time systems such as satellites, medical robots, and autonomous vehicles.
